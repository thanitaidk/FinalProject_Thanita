I made a digital prototype where the user taps on the screen to lock or unlock. The prototype can be used as a part of an app, or on a display of a smart car key such as BMV display key. Besides the interaction with tap-motion, the background behind the tap area shows the user if the car is lock or not using colours. Red indicates that the car’s locked, and green means unlocked. When the user puts in the sequence incorrectly, the tap counter is reset and the tap area turns yellow, telling the user to wait (just like traffic lights!) before trying again.
To unlock the car, it requires a tapping “password”, meaning the user must tap in a certain sequence to be able to progress. In my code, I had set the tap sequence to go from lock to unlock to: “tap, 0.8 second pause, tap, tap, tap”. To go from unlock to lock I had set the tap sequence much easier compared to unlocking process, if you recently went from lock to unlock, you can quickly tap once to lock again within one second, but if it had been unlocked for a while, a: “tap, 0.8 second pause, tap” is required. Additionally, I made the prototype sync in multiple taps on a browser and even on other devices using websocket, this is for users who share their cars with other people and this lets them all see the status of the car lock in real time. 
From the feedback I received from the user testing sessions, a lot of people were happy with the idea and wouldn’t mind having this added as a feature to their everyday products e.g. car door, stove, apartment/house door. Everyone thought it was a clear and perfectly logical that the red colour meant locked and green meant unlocked. Though, I was afraid there would be some people who thought otherwise, since the red colour is usually used as a warning, in this case, it could’ve been used to indicate that the car doors are left unlocked.
Many users love the idea that the unlocking process is more difficult than the locking one. When locking the car, the process should be easy and quick. The unlocking process should require a little bit of work as well as it should be personal to prevent other people from unlocking your car easily. If this was to be a made into a real thing, I’d like to add a possibility for the user to pick their own unique tap sequence before start using the product. 
Some weren’t sure if they like when the tap area turns yellow when the tapping sequence is wrong. I agree that it might not be the best option or the best-looking feedback, if given more time, I’d make the background blink instead.
Many were unsure if the synchronization would be useful to have. It could confuse a lot of people thinking they had forgot to lock when in reality, another user has unlocked it from their device without telling in person. When asked if it would help if the display also showed which person on which device interacted with the key last, they agreed it’d help but added that the whole syncing thing was just unnecessarily, and that it’s not of interest to be notified through the product what the others are doing with the shared car. 
Having the opportunity to make this prototype helped a lot for both me and my group in our final project. Everyone contributing an individual prototype made it easier for us all to understand each other’s ideas better by using this as a visual explanation.
